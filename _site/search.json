    "text": "Why the Police Killings dataset?\nPolice shootings are a sad reality of policing practices that back decades. While many are justified to protect the lives of innocent civilians, there has been an uptick in recent years of police shooting people whom they perceive to be a threat in the heat of the moment, but are proven innocent after the fact. These shootings can often be hard to analyze because there are many psychological factors that come into play when an officer decides to discharge their weapon, such as their training, the perceived threat, and even an officer’s internalized prejudice. Without further information on the psyche of a police officer, the reason why they discharge their weapon cannot be determined. However, their actions and surroundings can be analyzed to provide insight into how and why a shooting occurs."

    "text": "Analysis Goals\nOur analysis aims to understand the dataset on police killings, extending its scope beyond the original focus tracked by the Washington Post. We plan to include socio-economic factors like housing income, poverty rates, and population demographics. While initially associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, our goal is to explore how socio-economic factors intersect with incidents of police violence.\nBy incorporating these additional factors, we hope to uncover correlations and patterns that provide insight into the broader societal context surrounding police use of force. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues and support evidence-based policy-making for promoting equity and justice"

To avoid confusion, the values are recoded as Unknown using the mutate function.\nAdditionally, a secondary dataframe was generated by grouping the dataset bycity and race and acquiring the counts. This will allow us multiple avenues of analyses such as ascertaining whether or not the proportions of shootings by race in each city differs from the proportions of race in the cities in our census datasets.\n\n\n\nCensus Datasets\nIn addition to the dataset containing the fatal police shooting, there are four additional 2015 census datasets each containing over 29000 observations:\n\nMedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv\nPercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv\nPercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv\nShareRaceByCity.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nDescription\nNumber of Cities\n\n\n\n\nPercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv\nContains the percentage of individuals 25 years and older that are highschool graduates for cities\n29329\n\n\nMedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv\nContains the median income for cities\n29322\n\n\nPercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv\nContains the percentage of the population below poverty for cities\n29329\n\n\nShareRaceByCity.csv\nContains the demographics for cities\n29268\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach census dataset contains two common columns: Geographic.Area and City. The values for City is name of the city and a classifier (ie Alexander City city).\nIn addition to these two columns, each dataset contains information regarding the city’s demographic information: percent of highschool graduates, median income, poverty rate, and proportion of races (white, black, native american, asian, hispanic). Each of these values are numeric.\n\nData Cleaning/Wrangling\nFor ease of analysis, the four census datasets are concatenated together by city into one merged dataset.\nAdditionally, the City value is edited to remove the classifier from each label so that the city value between the main dataset and the census datasets will be equivalent. Doing so will ease analysis."
