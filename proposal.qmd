## Introduction

## Why the Police Killings dataset?

## Analysis Goals

Our analysis aims to understand the dataset on police killings, extending its scope beyond the original focus tracked by the Washington Post. We plan to include socio-economic factors like housing income, poverty rates, and population demographics. While initially associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, our goal is to explore how socio-economic factors intersect with incidents of police violence.

By incorporating these additional factors, we hope to uncover correlations and patterns that provide insight into the broader societal context surrounding police use of force. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues and support evidence-based policy-making for promoting equity and justice

## Dataset

### Main Dataset

```{r}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# Load in the datasets
fatality <- read.csv("data/PoliceKillingsUS.csv", na.strings = "")
median_income <- read.csv("data/MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv")
poverty_perc <- read.csv("data/PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv")
hs_perc <- read.csv("data/PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv")
race_perc <- read.csv("data/ShareRaceByCity.csv")

```

The PoliceKilllingsUS.csv is a dataset sourced from Kaggle using the following link:

<a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/data>Fatal Police Shootings in the US</a>

The .csv contains data between 2015 and 2017 and was compiled by The Washington Post. The dataset is comprised of 14 variables and 2535 shootings. An in depth description of the variables can be seen in the following table:

```{r}
#| label: dataset-table
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Create columns for data
fatality_var <- colnames(fatality)

fatality_desc <- c("Data ID",
                   "Name of deceased",
                   "Date of shooting",
                   "Means of death",
                   "Weapon/Tool",
                   "Age of deceased",
                   "Gender of deceased",
                   "Race of deceased",
                   "City",
                   "State",
                   "Sign of mental illness during incident",

                   "Method to evade police",
                   "Reports of police with body camera")

fatality_type <- c("numeric",
                   "character",
                   "date",
                   "categorical",

fatality_values <- c("2535 entries",
                     "Names",
                     "dd/mm/yy from 2015-2017",

                     "69 categories",
                     "6-91 years old",
                     "F/M",
                     "A, B, H, N, O, W, None",
                     "1417 cities",
                     "State 2 letter abbreviations and DC",
                     "True/False",
                     "attack, other, undetermined",
                     "Car, Foot, Not fleeing, Other",
                     "True/False")

# Bind the vectors into a dataframe
fatality_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(fatality_var,
                                      fatality_desc,
                                      fatality_type,
                                     fatality_values))
colnames(fatality_table) <- c("Variable", "Description", "Data Type", "Values")
row.names(fatality_table) <- seq(1:14)

# Generate a nice table with kable
my_table <- kable(fatality_table, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

#### Data Cleaning/Wrangling

### Census Dataset

In addition to the dataset containing the fatal police shooting, there are four additional 2015 census datasets each containing over 29000 observations: MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv, PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv, PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv, and ShareRaceByCity.csv.

```{r}
#| label: census-table
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Create columns for data
census_data <- c("PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv",
                 "MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv",
                 "PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv",
                 "ShareRaceByCity.csv")

census_desc <- c("Contains the percentage of highschool graduates for cities",
                 "Contains the median income for cities",
                 "Contains the percentage of the population below poverty for cities",
                 "Contains the demographics for cities")

census_n <- c(nrow(hs_perc),
              nrow(median_income),
              nrow(poverty_perc),
              nrow(race_perc))

# Bind the vectors into a dataframe
census_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(census_data, census_desc, census_n))
colnames(census_table) <- c("Data", "Description", "Number of Cities")
row.names(census_table) <- seq(1:4)

# Generate a nice table with kable
my_table <- kable(census_table, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

# Display the table
my_table

```

Each census dataset contains two common columns: `Geographic.Area` and `City`. City\` is coded in such a way that the column contains the name of the city and a classifier (city, town, CDP, etc.).

In addition to these two columns, each dataset contains information regarding the city's demographic information: percent of highschool graduates, median income, poverty rate, and proportion of races (white, black, native american, asian, hispanic). Each of these values are numeric.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1.  How do socioeconomic factors such as median income, poverty rates, and educational relate with incidents of police use of force across different geographic areas?

2.  To what extent do racial demographics, including the proportions of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American residents, correlate with incidents of police use of force within communities?

## Analysis plan

-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).

table_2 <- as.table(cbind(tasks, status, member, due, priority, description))
colnames(table_2) <- c("Task Name", "Status", "Assignee",
                       "Due", "Priority", "Summary")
row.names(table_2) <- seq(1:nrow(table_2))
