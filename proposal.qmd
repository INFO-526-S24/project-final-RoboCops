## Introduction

The police shooting data set is sourced from a Kaggle dataset, originally created by Karolina Wullum. The data was originally logged by The Washington Post after the Black Lives Matter movement was born out of the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. The data set contains information on fatal shootings that occurred from 2015 to 2016 and highlights information on the victims as well as the demographics of the city they were shot in. The goal of this project is to contextualize police shootings to further understand how and why these unfortunate situations occur.

## Why the Police Killings dataset?

Police shootings are a sad reality of policing practices that back decades. While many are justified to protect the lives of innocent civilians, there has been an uptick in recent years of police shooting people whom they perceive to be a threat in the heat of the moment, but are proven innocent after the fact. These shootings can often be hard to analyze because there are many psychological factors that come into play when an officer decides to discharge their weapon, such as their training, the perceived threat, and even an officer's internalized prejudice. Without further information on the psyche of a police officer, the reason why they discharge their weapon cannot be determined. However, their actions and surroundings can be analyzed to provide insight into how and why a shooting occurs.

## Analysis Goals

Our analysis aims to understand the dataset on police killings, extending its scope beyond the original focus tracked by the Washington Post. We plan to include socio-economic factors like housing income, poverty rates, and population demographics. While initially associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, our goal is to explore how socio-economic factors intersect with incidents of police violence.

By incorporating these additional factors, we hope to uncover correlations and patterns that provide insight into the broader societal context surrounding police use of force. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues and support evidence-based policy-making for promoting equity and justice

## Dataset

### Main Dataset

```{r}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false

# Load in the datasets
fatality <- read.csv("data/PoliceKillingsUS.csv", na.strings = "")
median_income <- read.csv("data/MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv")
poverty_perc <- read.csv("data/PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv")
hs_perc <- read.csv("data/PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv")
race_perc <- read.csv("data/ShareRaceByCity.csv")

```

The PoliceKilllingsUS.csv is a dataset sourced from Kaggle using the following link:

<a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/data>Fatal Police Shootings in the US</a>

The .csv contains data between 2015 and 2017 and was compiled by The Washington Post. The dataset is comprised of 14 variables and 2535 shootings. An in depth description of the variables can be seen in the following table:

```{r}
#| label: dataset-table
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Create columns for data
fatality_var <- colnames(fatality)

fatality_desc <- c("Data ID",
                   "Name of deceased",
                   "Date of shooting",
                   "Means of death",
                   "Weapon/Tool",
                   "Age of deceased",
                   "Gender of deceased",
                   "Race of deceased",
                   "City",

                   "Sign of mental illness during incident",
                   "Deceased's threat level",
                   "Method to evade police",
                   "Reports of police with body camera")

fatality_type <- c("numeric",
                   "character",
                   "date",
                   "categorical",
                   "categorical",
                   "numeric",

                   "categorical",
                   "logical")

fatality_values <- c("2535 entries",
                     "Names",
                     "dd/mm/yy from 2015-2017",
                     "shot, shot and tasered",
                     "69 categories",
                     "6-91 years old",
                     "F/M",
                     "A, B, H, N, O, W, None",
                     "1417 cities",
                     "State 2 letter abbreviations and DC",
                     "True/False",
                     "attack, other, undetermined",
                     "Car, Foot, Not fleeing, Other",
                     "True/False")

# Bind the vectors into a dataframe
fatality_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(fatality_var,
                                      fatality_desc,
                                      fatality_type,
                                     fatality_values))
colnames(fatality_table) <- c("Variable", "Description", "Data Type", "Values")
row.names(fatality_table) <- seq(1:14)

# Generate a nice table with kable
my_table <- kable(fatality_table, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

```

#### Data Cleaning/Wrangling

### Census Dataset

In addition to the dataset containing the fatal police shooting, there are four additional 2015 census datasets each containing over 29000 observations: MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv, PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv, PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv, and ShareRaceByCity.csv.

```{r}
#| label: census-table
#| echo: false
#| message: false

# Create columns for data
census_data <- c("PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv",
                 "MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv",
                 "PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv",
                 "ShareRaceByCity.csv")

census_desc <- c("Contains the percentage of highschool graduates for cities",
                 "Contains the median income for cities",
                 "Contains the percentage of the population below poverty for cities",
                 "Contains the demographics for cities")

census_n <- c(nrow(hs_perc),
              nrow(median_income),
              nrow(poverty_perc),
              nrow(race_perc))

# Bind the vectors into a dataframe
census_table <- as.data.frame(cbind(census_data, census_desc, census_n))
colnames(census_table) <- c("Data", "Description", "Number of Cities")
row.names(census_table) <- seq(1:4)

# Generate a nice table with kable
my_table <- kable(census_table, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)

# Display the table
my_table

```

Each census dataset contains two common columns: `Geographic.Area` and `City`. City\` is coded in such a way that the column contains the name of the city and a classifier (city, town, CDP, etc.).

In addition to these two columns, each dataset contains information regarding the city's demographic information: percent of highschool graduates, median income, poverty rate, and proportion of races (white, black, native american, asian, hispanic). Each of these values are numeric.

## Questions

The two questions you want to answer.

1.  How do socioeconomic factors such as median income, poverty rates, and educational relate with incidents of police use of force across different geographic areas?

2.  To what extent do racial demographics, including the proportions of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American residents, correlate with incidents of police use of force within communities?

## Analysis plan

-   Question 1:
    -   Plot 1: Regression x = percent HS/ median income, y  = count of police killings grouped by city and race, can overlay lines with race
    -   Plot 2: half-eye plot (need more variables for regression)
    -   Plot 3: Bar Plot Comparing Socioeconomic Indicators
-   Question 2:
    -   Plot 1: Leaflet plot, bar how crimes have changed in five years
    -   Plot 2: Leafetlet plot of crimes w.r.t. Population of each state { Crime Intensity }
    -   Plot 2: focus on certain cities/states and overlay
    -   Plot 3: Heatmap of Police Use of Force Incidents by Racial Demographics
