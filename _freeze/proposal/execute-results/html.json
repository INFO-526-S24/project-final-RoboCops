The data was originally logged by The Washington Post after the Black Lives Matter movement was born out of the shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. The data set contains information on fatal shootings that occurred from 2015 to 2016 and highlights information on the victims as well as the demographics of the city they were shot in. The goal of this project is to contextualize police shootings to further understand how and why these unfortunate situations occur.\n\n## Why the Police Killings dataset?\n\nPolice shootings are a sad reality of policing practices that back decades. While many are justified to protect the lives of innocent civilians, there has been an uptick in recent years of police shooting people whom they perceive to be a threat in the heat of the moment, but are proven innocent after the fact. These shootings can often be hard to analyze because there are many psychological factors that come into play when an officer decides to discharge their weapon, such as their training, the perceived threat, and even an officer's internalized prejudice. Without further information on the psyche of a police officer, the reason why they discharge their weapon cannot be determined. However, their actions and surroundings can be analyzed to provide insight into how and why a shooting occurs.\n\n## Analysis Goals\n\nOur analysis aims to understand the dataset on police killings, extending its scope beyond the original focus tracked by the Washington Post. We plan to include socio-economic factors like housing income, poverty rates, and population demographics. While initially associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, our goal is to explore how socio-economic factors intersect with incidents of police violence.\n\nBy incorporating these additional factors, we hope to uncover correlations and patterns that provide insight into the broader societal context surrounding police use of force. Through data visualization and analysis, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of these issues and support evidence-based policy-making for promoting equity and justice\n\n## Dataset\n\n### Main Dataset\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load in the datasets\nfatality <- read.csv(\"data/PoliceKillingsUS.csv\", na.strings = \"\")\nmedian_income <- read.csv(\"data/MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv\")\npoverty_perc <- read.csv(\"data/PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv\")\nhs_perc <- read.csv(\"data/PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv\")\nrace_perc <- read.csv(\"data/ShareRaceByCity.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe PoliceKilllingsUS.csv is a dataset sourced from Kaggle using the following link:\n\n<a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/data>Fatal Police Shootings in the US</a>\n\nThe .csv contains data between 2015 and 2017 and was compiled by The Washington Post. The dataset is comprised of 14 variables and 2535 shootings. An in depth description of the variables can be seen in the following table:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Variable </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Data Type </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Values </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> id </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Data ID </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> numeric </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2535 entries </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> name </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Name of deceased </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> character </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Names </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> date </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Date of shooting </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> date </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> dd/mm/yy from 2015-2017 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> manner_of_death </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Means of death </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> shot, shot and tasered </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> armed </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Weapon/Tool </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 69 categories </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> age </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Age of deceased </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> numeric </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 6-91 years old </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> gender </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Gender of deceased </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> logical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> F/M </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> race </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Race of deceased </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> A, B, H, N, O, W, Unknown </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> city </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> City </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 1417 cities </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> state </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> State </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> State 2 letter abbreviations and DC </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> signs_of_mental_illness </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sign of mental illness during incident </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> logical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> True/False </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> threat_level </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Deceased's threat level </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> attack, other, undetermined </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> flee </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Method to evade police </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> categorical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Car, Foot, Not fleeing, Other </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> body_camera </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Reports of police with body camera </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> logical </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> True/False </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Data Cleaning/Wrangling\n\nAccording to another Kaggle repository on the same topic and sourcing the same resources (<a href=https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/data-police-shootings>https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/data-police-shootings</a>), race codes unknown values as \"\". To avoid confusion, the values are recoded as Unknown using the `mutate` function.\n\nAdditionally, a secondary dataframe was generated by grouping the dataset by`city` and  `race` and acquiring the counts. This will allow us multiple avenues of analyses such as ascertaining whether or not the proportions of shootings by race in each city differs from the proportions of race in the cities in our census datasets. \n\n### Census Datasets\n\nIn addition to the dataset containing the fatal police shooting, there are four additional 2015 census datasets each containing over 29000 observations:\n\n-   MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv\n\n-   PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv\n\n-   PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv\n\n-   ShareRaceByCity.csv\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Data </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Number of Cities </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> PercentOver25CompletedHighSchool.csv </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Contains the percentage of individuals 25 years and older that are highschool graduates for cities </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 29329 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> MedianHouseholdIncome2015.csv </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Contains the median income for cities </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 29322 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> PercentagePeopleBelowPovertyLevel.csv </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Contains the percentage of the population below poverty for cities </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 29329 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> ShareRaceByCity.csv </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Contains the demographics for cities </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 29268 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEach census dataset contains two common columns: `Geographic.Area` and `City`. The values for `City` is name of the city and a classifier (ie Alexander City city).\n\nIn addition to these two columns, each dataset contains information regarding the city's demographic information: percent of highschool graduates, median income, poverty rate, and proportion of races (white, black, native american, asian, hispanic). Each of these values are numeric.\n\n#### Data Cleaning/Wrangling\n\nFor ease of analysis, the four census datasets are concatenated together by city into one merged dataset.\n\nAdditionally, the `City` value is edited to remove the classifier from each label so that the city value between the main dataset and the census datasets will be equivalent. Doing so will ease analysis.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\n1.  How do socioeconomic factors such as median income, poverty rates, and educational relate with incidents of police use of force across different geographic areas?\n\n2.  To what extent do racial demographics, including the proportions of White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American residents, correlate with incidents of police use of force within communities?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n## Timeline\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Task Name </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Status </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Assignee </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Due </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Priority </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Summary </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposal-For Peer Review </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> April 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> High </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Write proposal for peer review </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Peer Review </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> April 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> High </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Write up peer reviews for other groups </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposal-Updated </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> April 8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Medium </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Update proposal using peer feedback </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Proposal-Final </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\">  </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> All </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> April 15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Low </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Update proposal using instructor feedback </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n",
