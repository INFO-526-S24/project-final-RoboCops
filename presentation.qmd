# Project Overview and Dataset

## Police Shootings: An overview
- Police shootings are an unfortunate aspect of enforcing the law, as any loss of life is a tragic incident
- We aim to visualize and analyze police shootings in the United States from 2015 to 2017
- The data points were gathered on Kaggle and sourced from the Washington Post, so we are limited to their interpretation of what counts a as a police shooting

# Data Summary with Dashboard

<!--------------------------------------------------------------->

# Question 1

How do socioeconomic factors such as median income, poverty rates, and educational relate with incidents of police use of force across different geographic areas?

## Insights and Knowledge Inferred {style="font-size: 80%"}

- Cities with greater than 75% high school graduates and poverty levels between 18-25% experience the most shootings with roughly half of all incidents showing a threat level of "Attack"

- Most shootings occur in cities where the median income is roughly between \$40k - \$50k per year, roughly the US average

- White people are shot the most, with the highest raw count, but proportional to the overall population of each race, black people are shot more

- 1 in every 7,143 black people are shot by the police compared to 1 in every 333,334 white people. Thus, black people are 47 times more likely to be shot by police, a striking and sad statistic

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
# penguins |> 
#   head() |>
#   kableExtra::kable() |>
#   kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
